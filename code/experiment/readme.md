### Generating stimuli

To generate experiment stimuli yourself, first download the DIDEC dataset here. Then run the "stimulus_generation" notebooks (.ipynb files) in numerical order.

### Running the experiment

To run the experiment, you will need the attention video stimuli. You can either unzip the stimulus folder (fps_60) or generate the stimuli yourself, following the steps above.

Then, to run the experiment, open and run `experiment_run.psyexp` or `experiment_run.py` in Psychopy version 2023.1.2

Note: Reviewing our code and experiment data, we explored the impact of adjusting some settings and timing parameters, primarily for video stimulus display. The code here is intended to represent the original state of the experiment at the time of data collection (no adjustments), but we encourage users to tweak timing and display settings as needed to suit their design and equipment (external monitors, MRI set up, etc)
