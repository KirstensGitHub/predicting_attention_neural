### Generating stimuli

To generate experiment stimuli yourself, first download the DIDEC dataset here. Then run the "stimulus_generation" notebooks (.ipynb files) in numerical order.

### Running the experiment

To run the experiment, open and run `experiment_run.psyexp` in Psychopy version 2023.1.2

You can either make the stimuli yourself, or, to get started right away, just unzip the fps_60 file and use the stimuli stored there.
