### Generating stimuli

To generate experiment stimuli yourself, first download the DIDEC dataset here. Then run the "stimulus_generation" notebooks (.ipynb files) in numerical order.

### Running the experiment

To run the experiment, open and run `experiment_run.psyexp` in Psychopy version 2023.1.2

You can either make the stimuli yourself, or, to get started right away, just unzip the fps_60 file and use the stimuli stored there.

Note: In the process of reviewing our code and experiment data, we explored the impact of adjusting some settings and timing parameters, primarily for video stimulus display. The code shared here is intended to represent the original state of the experiment at the time of data collection (no adjustments), but we encourage users to tweak video display settings as needed to suit their design and any relevant equipment (MRI, EEG, eye tracking, etc)
