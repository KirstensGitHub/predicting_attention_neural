Each subdirectory here contains the experiment code (.html file) and video stimuli (.zip file) for one experiment (1-8) in our article [Predicting the Attention of Others](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2307584120?af=R). 

To run a version of the experiment, go into the relevant folder, unzip the stimulus zip file(s) then double click the `.html` file to open the experiment in your default web browser. 

Note that to fully replicate our procedure, you should use Firefox version 44.0.2 (downloadable here: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/44.0.2/) on Mac OS X 10.11. In different browsers & systems, the experiment may display significantly differently (see `predicting_attention/README.md`).
